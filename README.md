This is the january assignment from Zealand 2020

In this project I decided to create a Idle/Incremental game based on one of our classmates Mik (https://github.com/MikPedersen).

The game revolves around collecting Miks from there you buy new things to collect miks for you while you do other things. All of the Miks generated can be increased by upgrades and said collecting methods

How to play:

You play the game by pressing the start game button, from there you press the "Make Miks" button to generate Miks

In order to Auto-Generate Miks  you need to press the "Auto" button under the tool you want to buy

And to upgrade these tools you need to press the upgrade buttons besides the auto-button
